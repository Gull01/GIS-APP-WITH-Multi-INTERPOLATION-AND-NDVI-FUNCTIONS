# GIS-APP-WITH-Multi-INTERPOLATION-AND-NDVI-FUNCTIONS
A refined GIS app offering interpolation and NDVI functionalities. It allows users to upload raster and vector data, visualize spatial information, and perform analyses. Interpolation predicts values for unsampled areas, while NDVI assesses vegetation health using satellite imagery.
This Python-based GIS app, developed using PyQt5, enables users to visualize and analyze spatial data. Key features include loading shapefiles and raster files, performing NDVI calculations for vegetation health, and interpolation to estimate spatial values. The app offers an interactive interface, leveraging libraries like Matplotlib, GeoPandas, and Rasterio for data visualization and geospatial analysis.
